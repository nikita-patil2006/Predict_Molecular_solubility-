# Predict_Molecular_solubility-/

This project focuses on predicting the solubility of molecules, leveraging machine learning techniques. It utilizes molecular data and descriptors to train predictive models, enabling the estimation of a molecule's solubility.

## Project Overview

This project involves:

* **Data Handling:** Processing and preparing molecular data, potentially including feature extraction from molecular representations like SMILES.
* **Solubility Prediction:** Implementing machine learning models to predict the solubility of molecules.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained models using relevant metrics.
* **Enhancement Techniques:** Exploring methods like data augmentation to improve model training and generalization.
* **Robustness Analysis:** Investigating and addressing potential overfitting in the models.
* **Application Deployment:** Creating a user-friendly application to make solubility predictions.

## Dataset

The project likely utilizes a dataset containing molecular information (such as SMILES strings) and corresponding solubility values. This dataset forms the basis for training and evaluating the prediction models. Molecular descriptors derived from the molecular structures might also be used as features.

## Key Features

* Data preprocessing and feature engineering from molecular representations (e.g., SMILES).
* Implementation of machine learning models for solubility prediction (e.g., Random Forest Regressor).
* Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).
* Application of data augmentation techniques to enhance model training.
* Analysis and mitigation of potential overfitting issues.
* Deployment of an application for easy solubility predictions.
